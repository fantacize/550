Focusing on epic poetry (with Homer’s The Odyssey as a required text), drama, short stories, poetry, and the novel, students develop the skills to read a text critically, identify essential questions, and form thoughtful, coherent interpretations. Students practice refining and sharing their ideas through written and oral assignments, including a form-wide declamation contest. They develop their skills by experimenting with different types of writing and presentations, exploring or expanding their writing process, and developing their voices as writers and speakers. Because the creation and study of literature does not happen in isolation, students also read texts that allude to, adapt, alter, transform, and reclaim the narratives of traditional texts.

During this year-long course, students write analytical, creative, and descriptive pieces and read a variety of short stories, poems, plays, and short novels. The literatures are either from outside of Europe and North America or are ethnic literatures within their respective national context (including Europe and North America). The aim of the study of these literatures is to help students “develop a global perspective on cultural, social, political, and environmental issues” early in their Choate education. The texts serve not only as the subject of inquiry and analysis but also as models for student writers to enhance writing mechanics while also learning to consider how audience, perspective, and tone can be employed as students develop their individual writing voice and style.

EN300,AMERICAN LITERATURE AND COMPOSITION,Year,3,Year; 3 course credits,,,False,,"American Literature and Composition introduces students to the rich and varied multicultural traditions of American literature. Through the daily practices of reading, discussing, and writing, students closely analyze literary and cultural texts across a range of genres, forms, and historical periods with a focus on how those texts differently imagine America and American identity. Students also explore relevant information to situate the work of various writers and artists, particularly those whose work has traditionally been marginalized, within relevant cultural, political, and historical contexts. The course emphasizes a process-based approach to writing and as part of that process, asks students to reflect on the ways their experiences and identities contribute to their study of American literature and culture.","AMERICAN STUDIES Year; 3 course credits EN375 (must be taken with HI375HO) American Studies is an interdisciplinary field that examines the culture, politics, structures, and systems in what is now the United States from the time prior to European contact through the present. While focusing on the disciplines of English and history, American Studies also incorporates epistemologies from fields including art, media studies, political science, psychology, and sociology. Paired with HI375HO, EN375 progresses chronologically, supplemented with critical readings and contemporary interpretations of people and events in U.S. history. In addition to reading texts, students explore the social, cultural, and historical conditions in which the texts were produced. Archival material and significant works of U.S. literature that have been historically neglected are also examined. Along the way, EN375 considers questions including: What are the nation’s values? Who counts as “American”? Where does the United States fit within the global community? What do literary and cultural texts produced by US residents have to say about all this? The literature side of American Studies will consider these questions and more. Note: Fifth formers are eligible to take single-term electives concurrently with their fifth form English course with the permission of the department. Single-term electives taken in the fifth form year will not fulfill the English requirement for the sixth form year. In the sixth form year, students choose from a wide range of electives. Students may complete their three terms of English in several ways: by taking one year-long elective, or one two-term elective and one single-term elective, or three single-term electives (one of which must be EN400). The year-long electives offer students the opportunity to engage in a prolonged study of material that is thematically cohesive and multidisciplinary in approach. Students who wish to take a year-long course must complete all three terms of the course to earn English credit in the sixth form year. The two-term elective, Advanced Creative Writing, requires the creation of a substantial body of original work that has undergone significant workshopping and revision. By nature, this process requires significant time both for writing and revising, which is why the course is two terms long. Students who take Advanced Creative Writing may not take Reading and Writing Poetry (EN408), Reading and Writing Short Fiction (EN441), Reading and Writing the Graphic Narrative (EN445), or Playwriting and Screenwriting (TA270) as their single-term elective in the spring. The single-term electives provide students with variety in their study of literature throughout the year. All students who choose to take single-term electives are required to take EN400 in either the fall or the winter term as one of their three electives. Students may not repeat a single-term elective within their sixth form year. Note 1: Though every effort is made to accommodate requests for English electives, it is not always possible to schedule sixth formers into their first-choice English courses along with their other requests. Therefore, students must indicate at least two different choices per term (e.g., two different year-long electives or a total of six different single-term electives) when requesting English electives, to ensure appropriate scheduling of all courses and students. Note 2: A student who has maintained a minimum average grade of A- during the first two terms of the sixth form year may be allowed to waive the spring term if the student has the approval of the current teacher, the department head, and the college counselor. Note 3: A student who is taking a year-long or two-term English elective or who has been away from campus for a term is not eligible for a waiver. Note 4: Students who wish to consider this waiver option should discuss those plans during the course selection process during the fifth form spring; see pp. 8-9 for details. Students who wish to take single-term electives must enroll in EN400 in either the fall or winter term and must enroll in a minimum of one English elective per term. Students who are English enthusiasts are welcomed to enroll in more than one elective in any given term, but they may not use the additional course to fulfill the minimum requirement for a different term."

Although this recent spike in popularity has brought much-needed visibility and increased acceptance to the LGBTQ+ community, it has also revealed previously unexamined inequalities and disparities in terms of race, class, and gender presentation. This course aims to examine questions surrounding these realities by putting a variety of texts, including films and TV shows, into conversation with the more traditional fodder of the English classroom, i.e. short stories, poems, and novels. Alongside looking for answers to these questions, students in the course will learn to use the tools of literary queer theory and film studies as tools for close- reading and argument-making while exploring the roles storytelling has played in the history of gender and sexuality and while reflecting the queerness of society.",

There are new novels based on his plays and new television shows based on his life. There are new films and poems inspired by Shakespeare, and there are, above all, always new productions of his plays. Audiences, actors, and readers never tire of Shakespeare’s works. This course will examine several of his plays in depth and visit films, plays, novels, and television shows based on Shakespeare. What keeps Shakespeare’s works so fresh, relevant, and entertaining after four centuries? What is it about his language, his characters, and his thinking that intrigues us?

For members of the African Diaspora, what is constantly at risk of being left behind is historical and cultural memory. Students in this course will seek an understanding of some of what has been left behind — oral and religious traditions, an economy lost to colonial greed, and the deep beauty that exists within African identity itself — for so many people of African descent, by focusing on two West African countries. This term course may center texts such as, The Poor Christ of Bomba by Cameroonian author Mongo Beti and Homegoing by contemporary Ghanaian author Yaa Gyasi, to gain a vantage point into the creation of the African Diaspora in the United States.

We will examine how primarily contemporary Asian writers, through various encounters within and between cultures, explore issues of power and privilege in the context of globalization, sexuality, ability, gender, class, and race. Additionally, we will consider an array of narrative forms — comics, novels, short stories, and film — to learn how the peoples of Asia choose to tell their stories. Texts could include works such as Haruki Murakami’s Underground, Brilliante Mendoza’s Ma’ Rosa, Jin Yong’s The Book and the Sword, Yeon-Sik Hong’s Uncomfortably Happily, Qiu Miaojin’s Notes of a Crocodile, and Prabda Yoon’s The Sad Part Was. This course fulfills the requirement in contemporary global studies.",
EN416,LATINE LITERATURE,All terms,1,All terms; 1 course credit,,,False,,"Latine Literature introduces students to literature produced by Latine writers in the United States. While “Latine literature” is in some ways a contested term, that conflict is by no means new. Academics, bureaucrats, activists, and others have argued both for and against “Hispanic,” Latino/Latina,” “Latin@,” “Latinx,” and so on for decades, as well as who belongs under such designations and why. This course embraces these ongoing conversations to explore the diversity, depth, and complexities of Latine as a body of literature. We will draw on tools from literary studies, history, and sociology to approach this subject and study the historical, political, and socio-economic issues, such as immigration, language regulation, racialization, sexuality, and gender, affecting Latine literary production. Texts may include works by writers like Sandra Cisneros, Junot Díaz, and the Nuyorican and Chicano poets. By the end of the course, students will be able to recognize distinctions between Chicano, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, and/or other Latine literatures as well as connect moments in U.S. colonial and immigration policy to the literary production of the varied groups connected under the umbrella “Latine.”",
EN417,RETURN TO TURTLE ISLAND: INDIGENOUS LITERATURES OF NORTH AMERICA,Fall term,1,Fall term; 1 course credit,,,False,,"Indigenous peoples of North America have a rich narrative history that spans millennia. Given the varied tools and techniques deployed by Indigenous authors to express tribal identity and resist colonial erasure, this course will explore a range of texts, including literature, film, television, and other media. Through the study of contemporary texts and their historical precedents students will discover themes and ideas that are unique to Indigenous creators, gaining a better understanding of how these writers have responded to the ongoing impacts of settler colonialism with what scholar Gerald Vizenor terms creative strategies of “survivance.” Students will create critical and creative works in response to texts that may include Louise Erdrich’s Love Medicine, Stephen Graham Jones’ Ledfeather, Linda Hogan’s The Radiant Lives of Animals, Tommy Orange’s There There, Sterlin Harjo and Taikki Waitti’s Reservation Dogs, and Moonshot: An Indigenous Comics Collection edited by Hope Nicholson.",
EN418,IMAGINED FUTURES AND ALTERNATE REALITIES: THE LITERATURES OF TOMORROW,All terms,1,All terms; 1 course credit,,,False,,"What will the future look like? How can literature be used as a tool to better understand the present and to discuss the futures people want, and, of course, futures people do not want? Writers, filmmakers, and other artists have tackled these questions in such diverse forms as novels, poetry, independent shorts, and blockbuster franchises, to interrogate contemporary socio- political realities by presenting future possibilities. In this course, students will read science fiction, Afrofuturism, Indigenous futurism, and dystopian literatures to explore the trajectory from the past to our present, and on to potential futures. Students might examine works by Omar El Akkad, Nnedi Okorafor, Cherie Dimaline, Bong Joon-ho, N.K. Jemisin, and Boots Riley to understand ways that manifestations of oppressions intersect. Additionally, works like Black Panther, The Handmaid’s Tale, and Kafka on the Shore may be examined to see the ways writers imagine possibilities for resistance across marginalized communities.",
EN419,THE END OF NATURE: GLOBAL LITERATURES OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE,"Winter, Spring terms",1,"Winter, Spring terms; 1 course credit",,,False,,"This course introduces students to the global landscape of contemporary environmental justice literature, a landscape that revises our understanding of environmentalism, so that it includes both national parks and nuclear waste sites, scenic rivers and mega-dams, industrialized food production and multi- species health. A variety of environmental justice texts — in the form of novels, poems, plays, memoirs, comics, films, and other media —provide students with examples of individuals and communities responding to environmental problems. Such texts reveal how environmental issues are deeply entwined with issues of power and privilege in the context of globalization, sexuality, ability, gender, class, and race. Literary texts might include works by Amitay Ghosh, Ruth Ozeki, Drew Lanham, and Wangari Maathai, while media could include films such as Beasts of the Southern Wild and Flint. Students will have opportunities both to analyze these texts and to research and craft their own environmental justice narratives. This course fulfills the requirement in contemporary global studies. “IS THIS THE REAL LIFE?”: MODERN AND",
EN436,CONTEMPORARY DRAMA,Spring term,1,Spring term; 1 course credit,,,False,,"In The Empty Space, Peter Brook writes, “A stage space has two rules. One-Anything can happen. Two-Something must happen.” In the most important plays of the last 150 years, playwrights have played with both of these ideas, with dizzying variety and thought-provoking works that question what a play is and can be. From philosophical investigations of the nature of reality to the social and political issues of yesterday and today, these plays challenge, amuse, frighten, and inspire readers, actors, and viewers. Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, Eugene Ionesco’s The Bald Soprano, and Tony Kushner’s Angels in America are among the core texts we will look at. Playwrights like Henrik Ibsen, Alfred Jarry, Luigi Pirandello, Suzin Lori Parks, Harold Pinter, and Sarah DeLappe are often also included, as well as readings of plays leading right up to our own decade.",

EN445,PICTURE THIS: READING AND WRITING THE GRAPHIC NARRATIVE,All terms,1,All terms; 1 course credit,,,False,,"From the cave paintings in Lascaux and the development of pictographic alphabets, to the most recent refresh of your social media feed, people have always told stories making use of both image and text. With a particular focus on texts from the late- 20th and early-21st century, this course will provide students (especially those who do not consider themselves artists!) an opportunity to experiment with storytelling and argument- making using a combination of image and text. The framework for these essays will be established by critical texts by authors such as Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics and Lynda Barry’s Making Comics. Supplemental texts by authors like Zeina Abiriched, Alison Bechdel, Roz Chast, Mira Jacobs, Richard McGuire, and Art Spiegelman will vary, depending on teacher and student choice, and will provide students with models and inspiration for their work.

Students read a range of authors whose works investigate the relationship between literature, culture, and American identities. The course considers the historical, political, and cultural influences that have shaped how America is depicted, as well as the role of the narrative in the construction and representation of national, group, and personal identities. This course grapples with such questions as: What are the differences and similarities expressed in these identities? What do those similarities and differences indicate about the authors, their experiences, and America as a whole? Authors studied may include Alvarez, Bechdel, Coates, Diaz, Eugenides, Hong Kingston, Lahiri, Morrison, and others based on the interests of both the students and teacher.",
EN480,THE MODERN SPIRIT: THE LITERATURE AND CULTURE OF THE WESTERN WORLD FROM THE ROMANTIC REVOLUTION THROUGH THE AGE OF ANXIETY,Year,3,Year; 3 course credits,,,False,,"Beginning with the Romantic revolt against the Enlightenment in the late 18th to mid-19th centuries in Europe, continuing with the advent of realism and Modernism’s “shock of the new” in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and ending with the “Age of Anxiety” of the post-World War II American era, this year-long humanities course investigates the great cultural revolutions in Europe and the United States of the past 200 plus years. Each term, students will explore the zeitgeist — the spirit of each age — through some characteristic works of literature, art, music, film, philosophy, and social theory with the goal of coming to a deeper understanding of the modern sensibility. Literary works will include such novels as Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther, Shelley’s Frankenstein, Bronte’s Wuthering Heights, West’s The Return of the Private, Gide’s The Immoralist, and Kafka’s The Metamorphosis; lyric poetry of the Romantic and Modernist periods; plays such as Ibsen’s A Doll’s House and Sartre’s No Exit; films such as Battleship Potemkin, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Modern Times, The Triumph of the Will, and Dr. Strangelove; musical works from composers such as Beethoven, Chopin, Debussy, Stravinsky, Miles Davis, Joni Mitchell, and Bob Dylan; philosophical works from such thinkers as Nietzsche and Freud; and art from such movements as Romanticism, Impressionism, Cubism, Expressionism, Post Expressionism, and Pop Art.",
EN484,NOT MY TYPE: UNLIKE-ABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS,Year,3,Year; 3 course credits,,,False,,"Literary history and popular culture are full of unpalatable women: Clytemnestra the traitorous wife, Shakespeare’s Katherina the unmarriable spitfire, and Wharton’s Undine the mercenary social climber, to name a few. Audiences cheer as these women are tamed, tamped down, or otherwise punished, especially when the characters are viewed reinforcing stereotypes like the man-hating shrew or catty mean girl. Significantly, though, these characters draw ire not just for wreaking narrative havoc but also for breaking a social taboo deeply ingrained in Western culture: that women should be “like- able.” The “mother earth” figure is, by definition, nurturing, supportive, and often sacrificial. In contrast, archetypes like the “crone” or “witch” are villainized for their age, skill, and appearance. While stereotypical representations of “unlikeable” female characters reflect broader conversations about the roles of women and womanhood, writers have also taken up these archetypes to offer complex representations of women beyond like-ability. When viewed through this lens, these characters offer insights into how pressures to be “like-able” are linking to issues of personal choice, politics, and power. This course will explore literary and artistic reactions to feminist progress via “unlike-able” female archetypes. We will examine changes in representation and, by extension, cultural understandings of womanhood over time as well as investigate the roles of race, class, sexuality, and (dis)ability.",
EN485,THE EMPIRE WRITES BACK: POSTCOLONIAL LITERATURE,Year,3,Year; 3 course credits,,,False,,"Clashes in Gaza, the dismantling of statues in South Africa and the American South, and an Indian writer winning England’s most prestigious literary prize, the Booker of Bookers, reveal the lingering impact of colonial histories. Retribution, reconciliation, violence, and magical reality shape both the postcolonial world and its literature. After centuries of foreign rule, writers from former European colonies across Africa, Asia, and the Americas have written back to their own people and their colonizers. This body of work represents one of the most significant developments in global literature since the mid-20th century. In this course, students study the vast and diverse topics associated with the creation and eventual disintegration of the colonial projects of Europe. Multidisciplinary in approach, students examine literature, history, film, philosophy, theory, oral history, and art. This course explores the inspiration, justification, and manifestation of colonization as well as the resistance to this project. Students develop familiarity with theoretical terms and concepts and employ them to understand the tension reflected in the works studied, and to gain insight into the lasting effects for the contemporary global landscape. Writers studied may include Jamaica Kincaid (Antigua), Amié Césaire (Martinique), Salman Rushdie (India), Nadine Gordimer (South Africa), and Toni Morrison (U.S.), among others. This course fulfills the requirement in contemporary global studies.",
EN486,JOURNALISM AND NONFICTION STORYTELLING,Year,3,Year; 3 course credits,,,False,,"Nonfiction storytelling, whether it is daily journalism, long-form magazine writing, personal essays, opinion pieces, radio broadcasts, or another variety, is invariably based in fact. The creator is circumscribed by what happened, and yet these works can be as gripping and nuanced as any work of fiction. Unlike a novelist, a nonfiction storyteller cannot invent a character or fabricate a cliff-hanging plot twist. Like a novelist, a nonfiction storyteller is free to experiment with form, detail, diction, syntax, metaphor, and the like. Understanding this dynamic is key to the work of this course. Students study the foundational elements of a fact-based story. What makes such a story compelling, provocative, or simply, fun? How does one go about uncovering and relaying such a narrative? How can elements like rhetoric, structure, and data enhance a story? How can stories change the world? Students analyze short and long nonfiction, both contemporary and canonical, and work individually and collaboratively on storytelling projects that address current issues. They engage in a diversity of narrative forms — the written word, comics, infographics, podcasts, photojournalism, and video — and study a group of writers that likely includes James Baldwin, Joan Didion, Ian Frazier, Janet Malcolm, John McPhee, Dorothy Parker, David Foster Wallace, Tom Wolfe, and others. Students share their work with their classmates regularly, providing and receiving appropriate feedback. WRITING WORKSHOP COURSES Writing workshops focus on the creation of original writing by each student and the regular exchange of feedback regarding that work among the participants in the class. While these classes may study short stories, novels, and poems by a variety of authors as examples and ideals of craft, the original writing created by each of the students serves as the primary text studied and discussed in class. Note: Unless otherwise indicated, the writing workshop courses do not fulfill the English department diploma requirements.",

Genres may include but are not limited to slam/spoken word poetry, stream of consciousness, flash fiction, rhymed and metered poetry, dramatic monologues, short dramatic scenes, and personal essays. The workshop is the heart of the class: students are regularly required to read their work aloud and have their work critiqued in a structured, formal, and productive fashion. Students not only periodically lead workshops on their peers’ manuscripts, but are also expected to edit, comment upon, and offer suggestions for improvement in every session. Students devote the last weeks of the fall and all of the winter term to composing and revising their final project. Students will devise, plan, and work steadily on completing a portfolio of revised and polished writing that has incorporated the feedback received in the workshop. The portfolio may include short stories, a chapbook of poems, a novella, a play, or a combination of multiple genres. Students consult the instructor regarding their individual plans, but the final choice of what will be included in the portfolio is theirs. Throughout the course, students are encouraged to submit their work to publications, both on campus and beyond. The course culminates in a public reading in which students share portions of their work.

This course includes an experiential component that involves contact with the natural world at Choate and potentially beyond. Open to fifth and sixth formers, and fourth formers with the permission of the HPRSS department. Our objective in the Science Department is to give students a better understanding of, and a deeper appreciation for, the natural world. We are confident that the insights they gain through their study of science will contribute to their lives in a variety of important ways: it will improve their skills in critical thinking and problem solving; it will inform their decision making about scientific issues; it will give them confidence and resources to tackle an array of global problems related to resources and technology; and ideally, it will enhance their enjoyment of nature’s marvels and encourage them to pursue further study in those areas of science which most interest them. Through our varied curriculum we train students to think critically and communicate clearly about scientific topics, we encourage curiosity and experimentation, and we teach techniques and technologies that are most useful in scientific research. The study of physical sciences (physics and chemistry) acquaints students with the laws governing the inanimate universe and promotes quantitative scientific thinking and problem-solving skills. The study of biology introduces students to principles that unify all life on our planet and gives students important perspectives on the human species. Because we view both areas of learning as critical for students at the secondary school level, we require that all students take a full year of physical science (either physics or chemistry) and a full year of biology. These courses include a rich laboratory program, as direct, hands-on experience with measurement and data analysis helps students become fully aware of the challenges, limitations, and the excitement of doing scientific research. Although only two years of science are required, we strongly recommend that students take all three core science courses — physics, chemistry, and biology — in that order. This sequence puts the most fundamental topics first, so that later courses can build upon central concepts taught in earlier ones. We work with sixth form year to place them appropriately into our science sequence. Introductory (first-year) courses are offered at regular and honors levels in physics, chemistry, and biology. Honors courses are designed for students with particularly strong aptitude and interest, and entrance into these courses requires permission of the department. Elective courses are offered in each of these three scientific disciplines as well as in geology, environmental science, and applied science. Our elective courses cover a wide variety of specific topics and run the gamut from year-long college-level courses to one-term introductory courses at regular, advanced, and honors levels. All science courses, except for Astronomy (PH320 and PH330) and Geology (ES310 and ES330), include laboratory work as an integral part of the curriculum. For sixth formers who wish to pursue intensive coursework in a particular area and then devote themselves to a project of their choosing, the Capstone Program is available by application. For rising fifth formers who wish to involve themselves in serious, original scientific investigation, the Science Research Program and the Environmental Immersion Program provide rich and challenging experiences. Viewed as a whole, the courses and opportunities available in the Science Department enable students to design programs with balance, rigor, and depth appropriate for all levels of ability and interest. – Kevin Rogers, Department Head",

What happens when we question our default settings? What does it feel like to be fully present, to let go, or to act from compassion instead of fear?

LANGUAGES Knowing a language other than English is an important skill for a 21st century citizen of any country. Beyond being a tool of communication, a language is a window into the history, culture, and literature of other places and peoples. Indeed, the study of language in adolescence can, by exposing students to different cultural practices and points of view, help shape their personality. Studying another language broadens a young person’s possibilities for self-definition and reduces the “foreignness” of others. It also builds and sharpens cognitive skills that will buoy a person throughout life. The Language Department aims to bring its students to a level of proficiency that will permit them to communicate effectively in a second language and to discover and appreciate other cultures, either modern or ancient. An emphasis is placed on decolonizing the study of language, providing opportunities to explore different voices and cultures, while creating space for inclusive language practices, including the use of non-binary pronouns and language. Increased self-confidence, the enjoyment of other cultures, and a greater potential for empathy, appreciation, and acceptance of all backgrounds are among the benefits we believe our students gain from language study. In the study of modern languages, full immersion in the target language is emphasized right from the beginning; reading, writing, listening, and speaking are all important components of our curriculum, as is the study of culture. Though English is the primary language of instruction for students of Latin, emphasis is increasingly placed on the active use of Latin in oral and written production in the first year. As students in second- and third-year courses progress, they encounter reading and audio materials of varying length. Fourth- and fifth-year courses in all languages are opportunities to use the language to explore literature, history, civilization, contemporary issues, and culture, though in some cases linguistic proficiency is still the main goal. Although some of the languages taught at Choate may be reputed to be more challenging to learn, we tailor our curriculum so that a more difficult language does not make for a more difficult language course. By the same token, a more familiar language does not necessarily make for an easier language course. Our courses aim to teach students: • a sense of linguistic and cultural curiosity; • the value of taking academic risks and making mistakes; • patience, persistence, and humility in pursuing a difficult endeavor that takes time; • to recognize and assimilate patterns in language; • to discover that accuracy and detail are essential to good communication; • to know the value of consistent, methodical, and self- directed preparation; • to know and exercise the power of rhetoric in speaking and writing; • to understand that language is infused with cultural information; • to appreciate the English language as seen through the lens of another language; • to recognize the untranslatable in each language; and • empathy for, and understanding of, difference. complete a course of study through the third year (300 or 350 level) in Arabic, Chinese, French, Latin, or Spanish, or through the successful completion of the Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies (AMES) Program. The requirement in contemporary global studies can be fulfilled with a range of courses within the Language Department (see p. 10). – Charlie Fuentes, Department Head Note: New students are placed in an appropriate language course by the department based on an assessment of some or all the following: the student’s placement test, test scores, previous grades, stated language experience, and teacher questionnaire.",

MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER The quantitative nature of our world makes it imperative for students to achieve literacy and proficiency with mathematical concepts, methods, and problem-solving strategies. Mathematics as a system of thought is considered a core part of the human cultural experience. Computer Science offers students the opportunity to leverage their mathematical talents to create machines and applications that express their ingenuity and passion. Our mission is to help students appreciate these disciplines in both their pure and applied forms. The department focuses on the development of logical, analytical, and critical thinking skills. To this end, teachers expect clear, cogent arguments in students’ written work and increasingly emphasize the ability to read and discuss mathematics as students mature. Through a mixture of standard and novel problem types, students also develop self-confidence and creativity, thus enabling them to reach the highest level in our curriculum that their ability and discipline will allow. The mathematics requirement consists of Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II. Most students continue beyond the required courses. The honors sequence puts a relatively greater emphasis on formal mathematical theory and rigor and moves at a faster pace. For new students, math placement is based on the student’s previous mathematics history, a questionnaire completed by a former mathematics teacher, and a diagnostic assessment. For returning students, placement is made by teacher recommendation and the approval of the department head. While many students may want to work ahead in the summer months, we believe that taking a full-year course on campus is best. Thus, for students interested in doing summer work, we encourage enrichment programs (rather than attempting to learn the equivalent of the courses we offer at Choate). There are rare instances in which a student may appeal to the department head to take a course over the summer. In such cases, the student must get formal, prior approval from the department head and must take and pass a substantive placement test on campus in the fall before final approval and a course change is permitted. Extensive course offerings enable students to master traditional topics as well as gain an awareness of current developments in pure and applied mathematics. Incorporating advances in technology, our courses allow students to use computing to solve problems and examine data. Computer Science courses emphasize structured programs and techniques and develop organizational and problem-solving skills. Students may compete in regional and national mathematics, robotics, and computer science contests, and participate in the peer tutoring program. Given the many options available in the mathematics curriculum, students may consult with their teacher, adviser, form dean, or the department head to help plan their mathematics programs. – Andrea B. Sorrells, Department Head",
SR550HO,"SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH I, HONORS: INTRODUCTION TO PROFESSIONAL RESEARCH",Year,3,Year; 3 course credits,,Science Research Program (SRP),True,,"The goal of the on-campus coursework is to teach students about various aspects of scientific investigation including conducting background research, experimental design, data collection, data analysis, formal presentation, and to prepare students for their individual work in a research laboratory over the summer. In the biological science-focused section, students gain hands-on experience with modern experimental techniques including DNA and protein analysis and genetic engineering. In the physical science-focused section, students expand their knowledge of sensor technology, indirect measurement techniques, quantitative analysis, and data presentation through a series of intensive research projects and labs. In both sections, formal and informal literature searches are carried out to support each experiment or project, and significant time is spent mastering the use of database/search engines. The underlying goal is for students to learn how to critically read complex scientific literature, apply that understanding to their own experiments and analyses, make scientific presentations, and assess the work of others. During the fall or winter terms, students are expected to secure a research internship in an academic (or comparable) research laboratory. The program directors will provide support and guidance throughout the search process. The spring term consists of intensive individualized preparation for each student’s upcoming summer research project. Students write a comprehensive review article of the work done by their mentor and others in their field of research. The review article is a significant document that should not only prepare students for the work they will complete in the summer, but also allow them to polish their scientific writing skills. Students may also dedicate significant time to developing specific skills essential to the research of their lab (coding language, instrument procedures, etc.). Open to fifth formers by application in the winter of the fourth form year.

ENGLISH The curriculum of the English Department emphasizes the development of skills in reading, writing, speaking, and thinking. Small classes — on average, 12 students — provide an environment for lively discussions in which students learn to analyze challenging literature as well as to articulate their thoughts, reactions, and interpretations. A broad range of literature exposes students to ideas, perspectives, and experiences representing a diverse array of communities, both from within the United States and around the world. Frequent and varied writing assignments foster a strong foundation in writing process, composition, and style. Writing assignments support and encourage students’ ability to express complex concepts and develop their individual style and voice while engaging in thoughtful inquiry, reflection, and analysis. – Mark Gosztyla, Department Head In the third, fourth, and fifth forms, students take English 100, 200, and 300 respectively. In the sixth form, students may choose from a variety of electives. The English Department also offers one interdepartmental course during a student’s fifth form year: American Studies (EN375 and HI375HO), an interdisciplinary survey of American culture.",
