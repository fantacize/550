Working through this project taught me how much iteration is part of building software. The hardest part was not writing one page or one query, but getting everything to work together correctly the first time across routes, templates, and database data. I had to test, adjust, and retest multiple times when small implementation details caused issues, and that process showed me how careful you have to be with structure and consistency. Even though it was difficult at first, I learned how to debug more methodically, make smaller changes, and verify each part before moving on, which made me much more confident in building something full-stack. The use of AI to aggregate all the courses for the school also helped GREATLY, or else it would've taken me forever to filter the data.
