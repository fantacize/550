Implementing form handling and search made me focus on both user experience and backend reliability. For form handling, the biggest lesson was validating inputs on the server even when the page already has client side constraints, because users can still submit missing or invalid values and the app needs clear error messages and predictable behavior. For search, building flexible filters for course name, code, professor, department, level, and minimum rating showed me how small query changes can affect performance and result quality, so I had to structure conditions carefully and test combinations to avoid broken logic. Overall, this part of the project improved my understanding of how routes, templates, and SQL all work together to turn user input into accurate results.
